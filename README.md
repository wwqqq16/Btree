A B-tree is a balanced tree data structure in which all leaf nodes are at the same level. It is commonly used in databases and file systems due to its ability to maintain a balanced height while allowing for faster operations. B-trees are particularly efficient for large datasets as they reduce the number of disk reads and writes required for various operations.


The project is organized into the following files:

- `BTree.cpp`: The implementation of the B-tree class.
- `InternalNode.cpp`: The implementation of the InternalNode class, representing internal nodes in the B-tree.
- `InternalNode.h`: The header file for the InternalNode class.
- `LeafNode.cpp`: The implementation of the LeafNode class, representing leaf nodes in the B-tree.
- `LeafNode.h`: The header file for the LeafNode class.
