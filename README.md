Btree project for ECS 036C: Data Structures, Algorithms, & Programming at UC Davis. This project aims to implement a B-tree data structure, a self-balancing tree that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of records.

B-tree is a balanced tree data structure in which all leaf nodes are at the same level. It is commonly used in databases and file systems due to its ability to maintain a balanced height while allowing for faster operations. B-trees are particularly efficient for large datasets as they reduce the number of disk reads and writes required for various operations.

The project is organized into the following files:

btree.h: This header file contains the class and function declarations for the B-tree.
btree.cpp: The implementation of the B-tree class and its member functions can be found in this source file.
main.cpp: The main driver program to test the B-tree functionality.
